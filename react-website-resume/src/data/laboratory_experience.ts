      content:
        "Investigated the propagation of different weight percent nano and micro metal powders in different solvents, for solid fuel application.  Developed a Python script to generate G-Code printing instructions tailored to user specifications. Analyzed solid fuel burn rates and propagation of different composites under varying gas and temperature conditions utilizing Phantom high-speed cameras and a controlled combustion chamber. Collaborated with graduate researchers to conduct burning tests on various cross-hatched and standard manufactured samples containing different metallic powders and oxidizers. Evaluate propagation of samples and burn rate efficiency for solid fuel optimization.",
